Okay, here is a detailed user story for the clinician interacting with the front-end interface powered by the agentic Gen AI clinical trial matching workflow.
User Story: Clinician Accesses AI-Suggested Clinical Trials for Patient
ID: CTM-001
Title: View AI-Generated Clinical Trial Matches for a Specific Patient
As a: Clinician (e.g., Oncologist, Primary Care Physician, Research Nurse)
I want to: Initiate an automated search within my patient's record or a connected dashboard, and view a clear, concise list of potentially suitable, actively recruiting clinical trials identified by an AI agentic system
So that I can:
Efficiently identify relevant clinical trial opportunities for my patient without extensive manual searching.
Quickly understand why specific trials are suggested based on key patient data points and trial criteria.
Easily access further details about promising trials (e.g., full protocol, contact info).
Save significant time and effort compared to manual review of EHRs and trial databases.
Facilitate timely and informed discussions with my patient about potential participation in research.
Increase the likelihood of connecting eligible patients with beneficial trial opportunities.
Acceptance Criteria:
Initiation:
Given I am viewing a specific patient's chart/dashboard in the system,
When I click a dedicated "Find Clinical Trials" button or trigger the function,
Then the system should initiate an asynchronous request to the backend Python/Langchain service, passing necessary (anonymized or permissioned) patient identifiers or relevant clinical data summary.
Processing Indication (React):
Given the request has been sent,
While the backend agents are processing (fetching data, querying databases, analyzing protocols, matching criteria via Langchain),
Then the React frontend should display a clear loading indicator (e.g., spinner, "Searching for trials...") to inform me that the process is running.
Successful Results Display (React):
Given the backend successfully identifies potential trial matches,
When the processing completes,
Then the React component should display a ranked or sorted list of potential clinical trials.
And each trial listed must clearly show:
Trial Identifier (e.g., NCT number) & Title.
Current Recruitment Status (must indicate "Recruiting").
Study Phase.
Brief Summary/Condition(s) Treated.
Location(s) (relevant to patient/configured search radius).
Key reasons for the match (e.g., "Matches diagnosis: Stage III NSCLC", "Meets age criteria", "Acceptable prior treatment history").
Any potential flags or uncertainties identified by the AI (e.g., "Requires confirmation of specific lab value date", "Potential exclusion based on ambiguous note").
A clear, clickable link to the full trial details (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov page or internal protocol document).
Contact information for the trial site/coordinator, if available.
No Results Found (React):
Given the backend processing completes but no suitable, actively recruiting trials are found matching the criteria,
When the processing completes,
Then the React component should display a clear message indicating that no matching trials were found (e.g., "No suitable recruiting trials found based on current criteria.").
Error Handling (React):
Given an error occurs during the backend processing (e.g., API timeout, data access issue, Langchain agent failure),
When the frontend receives an error status from the API,
Then the React component should display a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Could not complete trial search at this time. Please try again later or contact support.") without exposing technical details.
Responsiveness & Performance:
Given the results are displayed,
Then the UI should be responsive and render clearly on standard clinic workstations/devices.
And the results should ideally be returned within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., under 30-60 seconds, acknowledging the complexity of backend processing).
Data Privacy:
Given the feature involves patient data and trial information,
Then all data handling, transmission (between React frontend and Python backend), and processing must adhere strictly to HIPAA regulations and institutional data privacy policies.
Technical Notes/Implementation Considerations:
Frontend (React):
A dedicated React component (e.g., <ClinicalTrialMatcher />) will manage the state (idle, loading, success, error).
Use axios or fetch for asynchronous API calls to the backend.
Consider using a state management library (like Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Context API) if the component's state becomes complex or needs sharing.
Utilize a UI component library (like Material UI, Ant Design) for consistent styling and pre-built elements (lists, cards, spinners, links, messages).
Implement clear visual cues for matched criteria and potential flags.
Backend (Python/Langchain):
An API endpoint (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) will receive the request from the React frontend.
This endpoint orchestrates the Langchain agents:
Agent 1: Securely fetches/receives relevant patient data.
Agent 2: Queries trial databases (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov API, internal DBs).
Agent 3: Uses Langchain's capabilities (LLMs, document loaders, chains, potentially vector stores for criteria embedding) to parse protocols and perform the complex matching logic against patient data.
Return a structured JSON response containing the list of trials, match reasons, flags, links, etc., or appropriate status/error codes.
Ensure robust error handling and logging.
Implement caching strategies where appropriate (e.g., for trial protocol data).
API Contract: Define a clear API contract between the React frontend and the Python backend specifying request parameters and expected response formats for success, no results, and error states.
