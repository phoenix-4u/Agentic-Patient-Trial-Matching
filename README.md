**Accelerate clinical trial recruitment by intelligently matching patients to relevant studies using agentic AI.**

This project demonstrates a modern web application leveraging AI agents (orchestrated via Langchain) to automatically parse patient data (mocked) and complex clinical trial protocols, presenting potential matches directly to clinicians within a user-friendly interface.

## üåü Key Features

*   **ü§ñ Agentic AI Matching:** Utilizes a backend powered by Python, FastAPI, and Langchain to orchestrate agents that:
    *   Simulate fetching and processing patient profiles.
    *   Simulate querying external trial databases (like ClinicalTrials.gov).
    *   Employ LLMs (mocked/conceptualized) via Langchain to analyze complex eligibility criteria against patient data.
*   **‚ö° Fast & Responsive UI:** Modern frontend built with React (using Vite) and Material UI (MUI) for a professional, cutting-edge look and feel.
*   **üìã Ranked & Explained Results:** Displays potential trial matches ranked by relevance.
*   **‚úÖ Clear Match Rationale:** Shows *why* the AI suggested a specific trial based on key criteria.
*   **‚ö†Ô∏è Flags Potential Issues:** Highlights uncertainties or potential exclusion criteria identified by the AI, prompting further clinician review.
*   **üîó Direct Links:** Provides easy access to full trial details on external registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov).
*   ** M** **ock Data Simulation:** Uses predefined mock patient and trial data for demonstration purposes, allowing exploration without real PHI or complex setup.
*   **üîÑ Clear Status Indicators:** Provides user feedback during searching (loading spinners) and displays informative messages for errors or "no matches found" scenarios.

## ü§î Why This Project?

Finding and enrolling suitable patients is a major bottleneck in clinical research. Manual matching is time-consuming, error-prone, and limited by clinician bandwidth and awareness. This project demonstrates how AI agents can:

*   **Save Significant Clinician Time:** Automates the laborious process of sifting through records and protocols.
*   **Improve Match Quality:** Systematically compares detailed criteria, potentially reducing screen failures.
*   **Increase Patient Access:** Identifies opportunities that might otherwise be missed.
*   **Accelerate Research:** Helps fill trials faster, bringing treatments to patients sooner.
*   **Showcase Modern AI:** Provides a practical example of agentic AI workflows in healthcare.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

Prerequisites:

Node.js (v18 or later recommended) with npm

Python (v3.9 or later recommended)

pip and venv (usually included with Python)

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
```


**2. Backend Setup:**

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure Environment Variables (Optional for Mock)
# Create a .env file (copy from .env.example if provided)
# For real LLM integration, you would add:
# OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here" # Or key for other LLM

# Deactivate virtual environment when done (optional)
# deactivate
```

**3. Frontend Setup:**

```bash
# Navigate back to the root and then to the frontend directory
# (Assuming you are in the 'backend' directory from the previous step)
cd ../frontend
# If you are in the root directory:
# cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure Environment Variables
# Create a .env file in the 'frontend' directory
# Add the backend API URL:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

```markdown
**‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application**

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   Open a terminal in the `backend` directory.
    *   Activate the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate` or `.\venv\Scripts\activate`).
    *   Run Uvicorn:
        ```bash
        uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
        ```
    *   The backend API should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`. You can test it by visiting `http://localhost:8000/health` in your browser (should show `{"status":"ok"}`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    *   Open a *separate* terminal in the `frontend` directory.
    *   Run the Vite development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   Vite will output the URL where the frontend is running (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser.
```

Error Responses: 404 Not Found (Patient ID invalid), 500 Internal Server Error.

üîß Configuration

Backend (backend/.env): Primarily for API keys if using real LLMs (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY). Not strictly required for the current mock setup.

Frontend (frontend/.env):

VITE_API_URL: The URL where the backend FastAPI server is running (defaults to http://localhost:8000 in the code if not set).

üîÆ Future Work / Roadmap

Real EHR Integration: Replace mock data fetching with secure, compliant integration with a real (or sandbox) EHR system.

Real LLM Agents: Implement the full Langchain agent logic in services.py using actual LLM calls, robust prompt engineering, and response parsing.

Real Trial Data: Integrate directly with the live ClinicalTrials.gov API (or other sources) instead of mock data.

Advanced Filtering: Add UI options for filtering trials by location, phase, specific criteria, etc.

Vector Database: Implement semantic search for criteria matching using vector embeddings for improved accuracy.

Proactive Matching: Trigger searches automatically based on new patient data or diagnoses.

Authentication & Authorization: Implement proper user login and access control.

Enhanced UI/UX: Add features like result saving, comparison views, more detailed loading states.

Testing: Add unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a demonstration project.

It uses mock patient and trial data. No real Protected Health Information (PHI) is used or stored.

The AI agent logic is currently simulated/mocked in the backend (services.py) for ease of setup and demonstration. Integrating real LLMs and data sources requires significant additional development, security considerations, and API keys.

This tool is not intended for real clinical use in its current state.
